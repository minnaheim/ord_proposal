# Call Info -->

<!-- ## Website

- Measure 1: Calls for Field-Specific Actions
- https://ethrat.ch/en/measure-1-calls-for-field-specific-actions/
- Explore projects will allow early phase exploration, testing and
  prototyping of what an ORD practice could be like. They will enable
  starting to engage with a community without necessarily building up
  something definitive. The aim is to help our researchers to explore if
  ORD practices can be developed and how.

## Aims

Funding for “Explore projects” aims at:

1.  Specifying ORD standards.
2.  Prototyping ORD tools.
3.  Building Communities to engage in ORD practices.
4.  Any other means that help explore and develop ORD practices.

It is important that Explore projects are not self-centred but emphasize
exchanges in the spirit of Open Science with other researchers,
technical experts, and stakeholders.

## Application guidelines (ETH Domain)

- https://ethrat.ch/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Application-Guidelines_TrackA_Explore_2nd_call_FINAL.pdf
- It is the declared goal to fund proposals that make tools (e.g.,
  software; hardware; protocols; standards; benchmarks; documentation
  and training materials; networking and education events, activities
  and resources) available which enable, facilitate and foster sharing
  research data based on ORD principles. Preference will be given to
  projects which engage and are connected to a community. Therefore,
  applicants are strongly invited to demonstrate why their project
  represents an ORD practice that encourages good research in their
  field.

## Application guidelines (ETHZ & EPFL)

- https://ethrat.ch/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Application-guidelines-Explore-EPFL-ETHZ-applicants-2nd-call-LATEST.pdf

For applicants at ETHZ

- In this Explore call, applicants at ETHZ must contribute 25% of the
  total budget from the resources of their lab/group/unit, either
  in-cash or in-kind. See the budgeting guidelines below for eligible
  contributions.

For applicants at EPFL

- In this Explore call, applicants at EPFL can be funded for 100% of the
  total budget. -->

# Proposal full title

swissdata: Making Public Data Public 


# Background and motivation

## Data as a key resource

- in our data driven age, data has potential
- firms with access to large amounts of data have "power"
- we need to recognize that data is of value, and should be treated as a resource that should be shared, so that everyone can benefit off its value.

## Leveling the playing field

- by making data accessible to the public, we remove hurdles for the public to access data, increases data literacy 


## Problem statement

Swiss institutions like the FSO, SECO, are responsible for sharing public data, which is essential for researchers. 
the status quo is that this "open data" does not always follow FAIR-principles, as we can see in the Screenshot below, depicting __________. 

<!-- insert description of what is to see in the screenshot -->

![Apache Airflow Tool](airflow_screenshot.png)

This is a problem because researchers spend precious resources collecting and cleaning data, which could / should be spent conducting research with the data. 

Solution: by launching a toolkit to collect data from various sources from the Internet, and making them available for download, swissdata aims to remove hurdles for data users by providing access to FAIR-data. This project is an important step in prototyping Open Research Data tools, since it transforms public data into FAIR-complying data, and thus supports ORD principles. In this project, public institutions such as the Federal Statistical Office (FSO), which act as facilitators, and a cooperation with the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule (ETH) ensure that this project will benefit from expertise from academia, government and industry (?).

<!-- can we also integrate that it creates ORD communities?-->

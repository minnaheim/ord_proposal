## Problem Statement

 Opnts bridges the gap between official statistics and academic research. Even though public availability of official statistics is decent (in Switzerland), data publications of regional and federal public data providers lack machine readability. Therefore these data publications are inconvenient to use for academic researchers.

 In the field of economics, for example, intertemporal comparisons play an important role. This implies regular and timely ingestions of data. Traditional data publications of (time series data) are often unsuitable as an interface between the data provider and the scientific consumer.

 Though application programming interfaces (APIs) from the official providers have lead to great improvements of machine reability of public data, the machine readability of public data is not homogenous across datasets.  Because modern economic (forecasting) models make use of hundreds of variables stemming from a large range of datasets, this heterogeneity is particularly troublesome for scientific use and the monitoring of the Swiss economy. Opnts mitigates this dynamic problem by providing an open technical framework, to ease the data sourcing and quality control burden, and by establishing a steady exchange (collaboration) between regional and federal data providors and its academic community.


- waste of resources, no solution while waiting for digital transformation, highly dynamic -> can't wait.
- data publication vs. time series, scientific use. 
- data is often publicly available but hard to digest for machines
- undeniably OGD has had great impact, data quality remains heterogeneous, particularly w.r.t. machine readability.
- methodological and technical advances (computing power) open up new possibilities but require high degrees of automation in data ingestion when models use large amounts of time series
- higher frequency, e.g., immediate evaluation of measures during COVID-19 regulations. 
- evaluation of forecasts (benchmark) ask for automation

<!-- in 2 ways: 

1. improving & spreading ORD practices (active discussions with FSO, teaching, FAIR principle inclusion)
2. code as communication (framework as a blueprint to communicate what we want to do, as an interim solution).

-> erhÃ¶he abstraktionsniveau, wir haben communication and technisches framework, bilden wissen, was bfs uns gibt, und 2. community building.

bridging the gap between academia and official statistics. 
way to do it: streamline publication, inclusion across all working packages. share a blueprint process on how to work with public data. 
have different entrypoints for different needs: data, source code, meta data etc. 
code as a communication channel,

## Background and Motivation

Though we hope to extend the approach suggested in this proposal to other fields in the future, we intend to focus on the disciplines of official statistics and empirical economics and their communities within the scope of this *Explore* proposal. Therefore, we present our background and motivation in order to contextualize our ideas with the example application we intend to *explore* in the proposed project.

### Time Series Analysis, Forecasting and Data Science in Economics

Given our team's professional background at the Swiss Economic Institute (KOF-ETH), our focus is on working with economic data. The Institute has a strong focus on data, as it plays an essential role in monitoring the Swiss economy. It produces a large number of forecasts and indicators for economic monitoring. Its data pool of company surveys is unique in Switzerland. KOF uses this data to generate various indicators (KOF Economic Barometer, KOF Employment Indicator, KOF Business Situation Indicator, etc.) that reflect the sentiment of the Swiss economy. It analyses its survey results on a quarterly basis and presents them to the public, as well as its economic forecasts and nowcasts. It also analyses the innovation activities of Swiss companies, provides studies on the labour market and healthcare expenditure and comments on current economic developments. The KOF is also involved (together with the ifo Institute in Munich) in the Joint Economic Forecast in Germany, which serves the German government as a benchmark for future economic development.

The bulk of KOF's database therefore consists of time series aggregating survey responses at various levels of granularity. Given the nature of the forecasts, which need to be evaluated and revised frequently, the data dissemination processes required to evaluate the forecasts need to be automated.

### Official Statistics and Public Data

- important source
- requirements of scientific use different from main focus: data publication. 


### Public Data / Open by default @ RSEED

Making economic data on Switzerland more visible and accessible is one of KOF's concerns. Given its role in academia and its resources which stem from the state (?), KOF is commited to making its data as open as possible, and as restricted as necessary. For this reason, the KOF, together with the Swiss Federal Statistical Office (FSO), has identified key economic data that are processed as Open Government Data (OGD) and made available on the opendata.swiss platform. For now, KOF has published its Economic Sentiment Indicator, Global and Swiss Barometers, and Employment Indicator.

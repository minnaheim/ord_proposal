# Impact 

<!-- **Instructions**
Please address these specific points:

- How sustainable is the proposed project inside the ETH Domain?

- To what extent will the planned project substantially advance the ORD
  field, or solve a critical outstanding problem in the targeted
  field(s)?

- To what extent does the proposal support a collaborative approach,
  involving significant synergies, complementarities, or/and scientific
  added-value to achieve its objectives? -->


The opnts framework ensures that the repetitive task of data dissemination is kept to a minimum, and thus saves the precious resources of researchers and data consumers. (solves critical problem) 

**FAIR-principles**

- *findable* because of publishing of software and data (on github, rOpenSci, and Dryad platforms, CRAN)

- *accessible* because low barriers to entry when publishing software on Github (and other OS platforms) and data on Zenodo (and other OS platforms), integrated into teaching

- *accountable* because the project raises awareness about potential for improvement within public insitutions (and exposure to community means potential to improve the opnts framework) 

- *interoperable* because of the ability to add supplementary packages, where researchers can apply the opnts software to their field 

- *interoperable* because of teaching, Hacking4Science means students from different fields and applications

**sustainability inside the ETH Domain:**

- used already at KOF (and will continue to be used)
- community rooted in academia (ETH, EPFL, etc.)
- opnts' community helps monitor and keep researchers accountable (sustainability)
- using the opnts framework for teaching helps leverage investments of FSO and gets students familiarized with FSO data and ORD principles 

**to what extent will the planned project substantially advance the ORD**

- integration into teaching
- ?

**to what extent does the proposal support a collaborative approach, synergies**

- collab with existing technologies (frictionlessdata,csv on the web) and their communities
- non-core packages created by community - for their needs and adaptions 
- teaching allows not only for accountability of framework, but improvements and interoperability (not only econs, but health scientists, etc.)
- cooperation with FSO in WP0 allows academic and public experts to be in dialogue and their ideas to be heard

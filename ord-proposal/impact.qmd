# Impact 

<!-- **Instructions**
Please address these specific points:

- How sustainable is the proposed project inside the ETH Domain?

- To what extent will the planned project substantially advance the ORD
  field, or solve a critical outstanding problem in the targeted
  field(s)?

- To what extent does the proposal support a collaborative approach,
  involving significant synergies, complementarities, or/and scientific
  added-value to achieve its objectives? -->


The opnts framework ensures that the repetitive task of data dissemination is kept to a minimum, and thus saves the precious resources of researchers and data consumers. (solves critical problem)


- opnts' community helps monitor and keep researchers accountable (sustainability)

- findability because publication on established platforms

- accessible because low barriers to entry when publishing software on Github (and other OS platforms) and data on Zenodo (and other OS platforms), integrated into teaching

- the project raises awareness about potential for improvement within public insitutions (advancement of ORD not only through opnts but effect on public institutions) -> accountability

- using the opnts framework for teaching helps leverage investments of FSO and gets students familiarized with FSO data and ORD principles (sustainable and collaborative)

- teaching allows not only for accountability of framework, but improvements and interoperability (not only econs, but health scientists, etc.)

- cooperation with FSO in WP0 allows academic and public experts to be in dialogue and their ideas to be heard (collaboration)

- include frictionless existing community practices (community run "universe" damit non-core packages von der community beigetragen werde, und die frictionlessdata leute beraten die Leute nur. Aber ich glaube es wäre trotzdem sehr gut, wenn wir deren projekt erwähnen, weil teil der bewertung ist "excellence of ORD practices", aka wie gut integrieren wir existierende ORD prinzipien und tools.)

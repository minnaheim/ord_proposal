<!-- **Instructions**
Please address these specific points:

- How sustainable is the proposed project inside the ETH Domain?

- To what extent will the planned project substantially advance the ORD
  field, or solve a critical outstanding problem in the targeted
  field(s)?

- To what extent does the proposal support a collaborative approach,
  involving significant synergies, complementarities, or/and scientific
  added-value to achieve its objectives? -->

opnts has the potential to be extensively adopted in many research and societal communities because of the following points: 

- opnts' community helps monitor and keep researchers accountable (sustainability)

- the project raises awareness about potential for improvement within public insitutions (advancement of ORD not only through opnts but effect on public institutions)

- using the opnts framework for teaching helps leverage investments of FSO and gets students familiarized with FSO data and ORD principles (sustainable and collaborative)

- cooperation with FSO in WP0 allows academic and public experts to be in dialogue and their ideas to be heard (collaboration)

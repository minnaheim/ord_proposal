**During the starting stage of our project, we coordinate with major public data providers and involve data sources in our planning early on. We do so in order to establish and maintain active, lively communication between public data providers and the scientific community.** 

<!-- activities & RQs -->
Publicly available economic data provided by the Federal Statistical Office (FSO), the Secretariat of Economic affairs (SECO), the Swiss National Bank (SNB) as well as regional Statistical Offices are important sources for economic research and monitoring of the Swiss economy. To develop an ORD spirit and a community of a data providers and scientific users of the data, it is crucial to involve these public institutions early on. Early dialogue helps to avoid reduncancies with existing data community initiatives and to develop a common understanding of *open data*, machine readability and datasets of priority. 

One of the core ideas is to leverage the investment into open data is to integrate public data into academic teaching to strengthen the connection between public administration and academia. To explore how to effectively use the joint expertise of public data providers, domain experts, data stewards of the ETH domain and data engineers, we launch a series of monthly meetups early in the process. The meetups are designed to foster inclusive expert discussions through publicly pre-circulated content. We are working to integrate our meetup series into the academic curriculum at ETH, but keep the series open to interested participants beyond academia.

<!-- communication through the opents project, code as communication channel --> 

In work package 1 (WP1), we lay the technical foundation for turning KOF Swiss Economic Institute's existing production process of macroeconomic time series into an open source framework that creates publicly available, machine readable scientific grade time series in fully reproducible fashion. 
Our approach uses license cost free open source software and aims to publish not only the resulting time series data but also the technical framework and infrastructure setup. Doing so ensures reproducibility and helps to comply with FAIR principles. Thanks to our infrastructure-as-code approach we can publish information on an ideal runtime environment in order to help others to operate their own instance of the *opents* framework.

Because an active community is inevitable to keep the project sustainable, i.e., well maintained, we chose the R Project for Statistical Computing as our main programming language for the implementation of the framework. R is known for its large and inclusive community with its annual user conferences [@inclusivecon] and vibrant local communities^[@rsebook discusses the importance of communities for the learner including experience from hosting the useR! conference 2021 which KOF co-chaired.] . Alongside its strong regional and international community, the fact that R is open source and free of license costs lowers the barrier to entrance and contribution considerably. In addition, R offers well established boilerplating ecosystems like *usethis* [@usethis] and documentation frameworks such as *pkgdown* [@pkgdown] or Roxygen [@roxygen2]. 

WP1 focuses on the homogenization of the data ingestion process across datasets and data providers. In a first implementation step, we identify common parts of the ingestion process.
We bundle these common parts in an R package that forms our core library and fosters reuse of source code. We encourage the community to use our core packages and to contribute by adding further dataset specific packages. To inspire contributions, we supplement the opents core, based on our long term experience as consumers of public data, with provider specific ingestion libraries written in R that cover dataset idiosyncrasies.

The above screenshot shows a traditional data publication of an official GDP statistic. 
Its use of multiple worksheets, empty lines and multi-line headers hamper machine readability.
Like many regular consumers of the information contained in this spreadsheet, KOF ingest this information immediately after its publication. 

![Screenshot of a machine readable data file, processed by an R based engine.](longformat.png)

In order to have homogeneous, machine readable format, we split this information into two files: a long format CSV file for the data and a JSON file for the metadata. 
The metadata file takes advanced of the JSON's ability to store nested data to store comprehensive, multi-lingual meta information. 
Our cooperation with the Secretariat of Economic Affairs....

At the end of WP1, we plan to iterate over the resulting datasets and data descriptions and enhance meta information where necessary. We do so in reproducible and transparent fashion by adding all changes to the source code that produces the data and metadata files.

## WP2: Publication

```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
tbl <- read_csv("data/tables/tbl-02-wp-activities-research-questions.csv")

a <- tbl |>
    filter(WP == "WP2") |>
    pull(`Project Activity`)

r <- tbl |>
    filter(WP == "WP2") |>
    pull(`Research Question`)

### Goals

The goal of Work package 2 (WP2) is find the platforms our community data and code components best and facilitates our approach to ORD. We will involve our data consumers and collaborators into this decision making process. Based on our *open by default* thinking, we will publish not only the resulting time series data and meta information, but all components of our software framework. In the process, we will work together with ETH legal service to find the most suitable open source licensing solution for all components of the opents project.

### Implementation

The *opents* approach suggested here, splits data and metainformation into two separate text files and formats: a simple .csv spreadsheet and a nested .json file for multi-lingual data description. Having two simple text files per dataset allows us to disseminate the resulting time series data on free, standard infrastructure such as GitHub that is well established in the open source community. The state-of-the-art rendering of .csv spreadsheets of git modern platforms sets the barrier to explore and consume our scientific use time series datasets as low as possible. Hence, the publication of data on GitHub, possibly using git's Large File Storage (LFS) extension, forms oru baseline scenario. Yet, in WP2 we explore the feasibility of other, complementary, regional and international publication channels such
opendata.swiss, r-universe or Zenodo.

<!-- CSV + JSON = opents , do we want to have a demo here ? code block mit .csv (README swissdata org--->

Technically, the *opents* framework consists of a core R package and several data provider specific ingestion packages. Again, we see the publication of all these components as open source libraries on GitHub or another major Git platform with good visibility as the baseline form of publication. In addition, WP2 explores which of our components are suitable for a publication on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). Publication on CRAN comes with requirements and quality control but opens up our work to a larger audience as endusers face the lowest possible hurdle to install our packages. 

<!-- example screenshot of GUI downloading package from CRAN -->


We will also explore more recent and experimental approaches such as r-universe which helps to improve our reach in the data science community. In WP2, we aim to expose our work to an rOpenSci peer review. rOpenSci shares our values of open and reproducible research through reusable and helps us to reach ORD excellence.

### Goals
<!-- less community, add hacking for RAs -->
The goal of Work Package 3 (WP3) is to create a community around opnts. This ensures that the opnts framework can not only improve its core packages, through feedback from the community, but also to expand its application into different academic fields. 

 - plan to present and promote opnts at UseR in Salzburg 2024 -> focus on framework, R package, CRAN publication, etc. 
 - integrate into teaching 
    - h4sci 2024 - enable students to use, integrate students ideas and their needs - 2025 - present framework, use software and data in teaching -
    - (h4ra)
 - connect to ETH domain RSE -> find contributers outside of economics - reach out of our field, environmental research, physicists, etc. -> different academic fields, data.
 - RSECON 2024 (in case of budget restrictions)
 - regular updates within community through out the project: opendatabeer, lovedata week, etc. - continuously establish and bolster community (sustainability, can survive without us)

### Implementation
<!-- hacking for RAs, use for H4Sci in 2025 -->
This will be done in three ways: by integrating the opnts data and software package into academic teaching aimed at scientists from different disciplines, by hosting the "R of Official Statistics" conference, and by participating in community events that allow different skills to come together.

<!-- Hacking4Science -->
The Opnts data and software will be integrated into the Hacking for Science course. This is a highly interactive online course that provides valuable big-picture guidance and hands-on software development skills to non-computer science students. The course aims to support researchers from all disciplines who are considering programming as part of their approach to working with data. The use of the opnts framework and data will not only help young researchers to work with CSV, the most popular format in the open data world, but also to understand its machine readability limitations and how to use opnts to transform non-FAIR public data into data they can use and share. Furthermore, the interdisciplinary nature of the course allows the students, who are D-MTEC PhD students from different academic backgrounds, to come into contact with opnts time series data and the opnts software, and to find applications for their fields and their data. This is made possible by the flipped classroom concept, where participants receive input on certain topics and then move on to self-study, where they decide for themselves which topics raised during the input sessions they want to explore in more detail.
<!-- hacking for RAs  -->

<!-- R in Official Statistics -->
<!-- BfS? plan to bring an established conference to zurich, Matt has experience with UseR, Euros, schweizer statistik tage -->
The international conference Use of R in Official Statistics is held annually in different countries. It brings together the global R community focused on the use of R for statistics, methodology and data science. By hosting the [uRosConf](https://r-project.ro/conference2023.html) in (2024) 2025, not only will the vibrant R community for statistics be maintained, but it can enable the opnts project to gain more traction and potentially more applications in different fields. 

<!-- Integration with other events, integrate/mention Wüst Guy, what are his other events, mention -->
 - plan to present and promote UseR in Salzburg...

Finally, opnts will be presented at a number of community events focused on research software engineering (and economic data). Existing community events such as RSE@ETH, RSECON 2024 and the RSEED at KOF meetup series have a large and intersectoral reach. From academia to administration and the private sector, the audience of these events is more diverse than that of a single event. By presenting the opnts project at conferences or events such as these, we introduce opnts to professionals in different fields with different open source needs and ideas for collaboration.







<!--- crap line

The source code that we develop at this stage aims to implement and communicate open data standards and at the same time creates machine ingestion friendly datasets. we benchmark and update data and metadata against as fair principle a benchmark of 






 When monitoring the Swiss economy, we compare publication dates, download files or consume APIs.
